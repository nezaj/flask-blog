## Flask Blog
A blogging platform written in Flask. Use simple command line tools to manage
and publish posts. A personal project for applying what I've learned with
Flask.

* [Installing](#installing)

### Installing
Flask Blog was built and tested in Python 2 exclusively. Before trying to make a [virtualenv][venv-docs], you should make sure that Python 2.7 is your system's default Python, and that [pip][pip-docs] is a Python 2 version of pip. (If that's not the case, you should uninstall and reinstall pip -- see the install directions on its [website][pip-docs].)
```
$ python --version
Python 2.7.3
$ pip --version
pip 1.1 from ~/.virtualenvs/rads/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip-1.1-py2.7.egg (python 2.7)
```
